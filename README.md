# TicTacToe
## General Information
Using the minimax algorithm, I created a program to play TicTacToe against a user, seen in tictactoe_minimax.py.
Then, I optimized the efficiency of the code by first implementing alpha-beta pruning, seen in tictactoe_alpha.py, and then by implementing memoization through transposition tables, seen in tictactoe_memoization.py.
